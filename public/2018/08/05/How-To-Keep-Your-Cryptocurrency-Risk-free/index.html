<p>With the current merciless run of the bull market, it is merely a few time before your crypto holdings surge in value.

<p>The question of why you need to purchase a wallet becomes the greater pertinent question of which finances should a cryptocurrency trader use. As do all types of insurance, security comes at the price tag on money and convenience. How should we balance it in a way that suits our risk profile?</p>
<p>In this post, I will sum up the unique features of the top 7 cryptocurrency wallets that an experienced holder must know of.</p>
<h2 id="Desired-traits-of-a-Cryptocurrency-Finances"><a href="#Desired-traits-of-a-Cryptocurrency-Finances" class="headerlink" title="Desired traits of a Cryptocurrency Finances"></a>Desired traits of a Cryptocurrency Finances</h2><p>What are the desired traits of any crypto wallet and how hard can choose a wallet to be? This specific seemingly easy answer, regrettably, does not have a satisfying answer: convenience may come at the price of security; additional features will come at the price tag on a steeper learning curve. More importantly, what are traits that, ultimately, you value over the others? See the list below, not so as of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost. Could it be free? Just what are the drawbacks of this wallet?</li>
<li>Security. Does the company have a track record of security excellence?</li>
<li>Range of motion. Is it easy to keep and difficult to lose? Is it accessible at any time, anywhere?</li>
<li>User-friendliness. Is usually the wallet UI without effort designed? Can I store a range of altcoins?</li>
<li>Convenience. Am I able to make a fast purchase when the time demands it?</li>
<li>Style. Will i have a weakness for cool technical gadgets?</li>
</ul>
