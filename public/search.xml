      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/6.jpg" alt=""></p><h1 id="The-Food-Industry-Blockchain-Applications"><a href="#The-Food-Industry-Blockchain-Applications" class="headerlink" title="The Food Industry -Blockchain Applications"></a>The Food Industry -Blockchain Applications</h1><blockquote><br>Err.. not really first thing that occurs to you when you think of ‘blockchain applications’, now is it?<br></blockquote><p>But, the fact is that many big shopping chains like Walmart are teaming up with IBM to integrate the blockchain in their food management system.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Very best purpose of doing so?</p><p>One of the most fundamental questions that we should ask whenever we consume any food product is: “Where is my food coming from?” </p><p>A great number of are becoming increasingly unsociable regarding the source of their food and this is triggering a lot of problems to not the particular consumers but the manufacturers as well.</p><p>Back in October 6, 2006 multiple states in the USA suffered a major E-Coli outbreak. The culprit? Spinach.</p><p>Around 199 people were afflicted of whom 22 were children under 5 years old. 31 of the 199 developed a kind of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In the end, 3 people died in the outbreak, one of whom was obviously a 2-year-old child.</p><p>As a result of this, your entire food industry went into pandemonium. People were desperately seeking to trace the source of the afflicted spinach. Everyone pulled spinach immediately from the marketplace. It took the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a total of 2 weeks to find the source of the contaminated spinach, for 2 weeks there was no spinach on the market.</p><p>Could you guess as to what the original source was?</p><p>This was one supplier. 1 farm. One lot.</p><p>Just that one lot shut up an entire industry devote weeks. For 2 weeks, farmers whose entire livelihood depended on spinach were left broke and broke.</p><p>All this would have recently been avoided if there was the way to search for the spinach.</p><p>But then this begs another question: Is ‘Letter Traceability’ really what we should be aiming for?</p><p>Is that really the best that we can do when it comes to the food?</p><p>Is traceability what we should be aiming for or can it be complete transparency?</p><p>As we have already seen before, tracing your meals are a very slow process. It usually takes a long time, during which entire industrial sectors and livelihoods may be shut down. So what is the greatest way to tackle this?</p><p>What if, we were to make each and every step of the procedure (from the time the food grows on the farm to the time it reaches the marketplace) transparent?</p><p>So, what happens if the blockchain becomes implemented here to maintain all the food data? Remember that the blockchain is an open ledger and the data in it is open to everyone and there is no core authority taking charge of the information. This greatly reduces the time that may be wasted going through unlimited red tape and hierarchy. In fact, having these data on the blockchain will reduce the holding out time from weeks to mere seconds.</p><p>Walmart has already done two test runs with IBM, one with Chinese pork and the other with Mexican mangoes. Walmart and IBM used the ‘Hyperledger Fabric’ a blockchain formerly built by IBM and now located under the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger group for these tests. Frank Yiannas, vice president of food protection at Walmart had this to say about the results of the studies (As told to Fortune):</p><blockquote><br>“We were so urged that we really quickly started reaching out to other manufacturers and suppliers as well.”<br></blockquote><p>As the blockchain gets more and more integrated into the food industry it will make the whole process more transparent and safer. The attributes of a transparent food system are a lot more (Taken from Frank Yiannas speech):</p><ul><li>Greatly enhances food safety.</li><li>Ensures fresher food since no person will risk sending ‘on-fresh’ food in an open system.</li><li>There is less food waste because every single bit of food is accounted for.</li><li>Stops food fraud because the machine is open for everyone to see.</li><li>Another benefit from an open system is that it promotes responsibility among the food producers since they now know that they can’t get away with underhand dealings.</li></ul><h2 id="Cybersecurity-Blockchain-Applications"><a href="#Cybersecurity-Blockchain-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Cybersecurity -Blockchain Applications"></a>Cybersecurity -Blockchain Applications</h2><p>On September 7, 2017 Equifax, one of the world’s most significant consumer credit reporting organization shocked the world when they says they experienced just faced a huge cybersecurity breach. They faced unauthorized data access from mid-May through July 2017 which they learned on Come july 1st 29. Around 145. 5 million were under the chance of having their personal information stolen which included:</p><ul><li>Brands</li><li>Social Security Number</li><li>Delivery Dates</li><li>Addresses</li><li>Driver’s Permit Numbers</li></ul><p>However, this was not the first time that a major cybersecurity breach happened to a well known company. Back in 2016, search engine giants ‘Yahoo!’ faced a major attack and around one billion dollars Yahoo accounts were affected. Attackers could actually get the following data:</p><ul><li>Names</li><li>Passwords</li><li>Telephone numbers</li><li>Answers to security questions</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, this wasn’t the first example of Yahoo getting hacked either since there are tons of DIY instructions online on what to crack Yahoo. Imagine how jeopardized the security of a company is when there are DIY guides about how to hack that specific company floating online!</p><p>When security companies like Verizon did their research they found certain trends. Apparently, 65% of the data breaches were because of weak, default, or thieved passwords. The industry considerable amount despite it being below the previous year’s (95%). According to their research, the key reasons why almost all of these episodes happen is that of the gullibility of the people themselves.</p><p>Time and again people fall for phishing attacks and they carry on giving away sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. In reality, Verizon’s report states that 23% of the people keep opening phishing email and half of them even open the parts which come along with that!</p><p>If you want to know the true depth of the problem, then consider this. Cybercrime costs the global economic climate $400 billion annually.</p><p>Thus, now the question is, how can the blockchain help prevent these episodes?</p><p>There are mainly 3 features which a blockchain has that can help prevent cybersecurity attacks.</p><h3 id="Feature-1-Trustless-System"><a href="#Feature-1-Trustless-System" class="headerlink" title="Feature #1: Trustless System"></a>Feature #1: Trustless System</h3><p>A blockchain system runs without the idea of ‘human trust’ As Derin Cag in his Richtopia article states, it assumes that any insider or outsider can compromise the system at any moment and hence it is impartial of human ethics.</p><h3 id="Characteristic-2-Immutability"><a href="#Characteristic-2-Immutability" class="headerlink" title="Characteristic #2: Immutability"></a>Characteristic #2: Immutability</h3><p>The blockchain allows one to store data and secure it using various cryptographic properties such as digital validations and hashing. One of the best top features of this is that as soon as data enters a block in a blockchain it can not be tampered with. This is called ‘immutability’.</p><h3 id="Feature-3-Decentralization-amp-Consensus"><a href="#Feature-3-Decentralization-amp-Consensus" class="headerlink" title="Feature #3: Decentralization &amp; Consensus"></a>Feature #3: Decentralization &amp; Consensus</h3><p>The blockchain is a decentralized distributed system. So how does anything at all get done if there is no key expert? The blockchain is constructed of a lot of nodes. Within order for any decision that must be taken, the majority of the nodes need to visit a consensus and make a choice. So, rather than a key authoritative figure, we have a democratic system.</p><p>These three properties provide itself greatly to cybersecurity.</p><p>Here are some real-life examples of blockchain companies disrupting the cybersecurity room.</p><p><strong>Example #1: Guardtime and real-time cyber-attack mitigation</strong></p><p>Guardtime is a data security startup founded by Estonian cryptographer Ahto Buldas. They have recently started placing up their sensitive data on the blockchain for the added security. Most security companies use the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which uses Asymmetric Cryptography and a cache of public keys. The problem, however, is that these keys are maintained with a centralized body (Certificate Authority). Since the system is centralized they may be vulnerable to attacks.</p><p>So, what Guardtime is doing is that they are utilizing the blockchain to create a KSI (Keyless Signature Infrastructure) to exchange the PKI system. It may be the world’s biggest blockchain company simply by revenue, headcount and actual customer deployments. In fact, in 2016 the organization obtained all of Estonia’s 1 , 000, 000 health records featuring a systems.</p><p><strong>Example #2: REMME and data protection</strong></p><p>How’s confidential data protected?</p><p>Back in the day, we had guards standing over the huge vault which stored your data for you. But obviously, there are a lot of issues with this system</p><p>It is highly inconvenient to look all the way to the vault each and every time you want to access information.</p><p>An individual are still depending on humans to stay honest. That’s hardly the best security model.</p><p>Then we shifted to username and passwords.</p><p>However, that is still risky because all those get saved in a centralized server and it can get hacked anytime.</p><p>So, REMME emerged up with the concept of making passwords completely obsolete. Every device will have their own SSL certificate, whose data will be stored on the blockchain. Because the blockchain is immutable, your data that gets stored in it can never be tampered with. That means all the devices and confidential data is secure.</p><h2 id="Downsides-of-using-blockchain-in-cybersecurity"><a href="#Downsides-of-using-blockchain-in-cybersecurity" class="headerlink" title="Downsides of using blockchain in cybersecurity"></a>Downsides of using blockchain in cybersecurity</h2><p>According to Brian Treat, the lead of blockchain practice at Accenture, while blockchain is a brilliant technology it is not necessarily designed to handle massive numbers of data. Since companies like Equifax handle humongous amounts of data a blockchain might not exactly be the best way to store it. But he added which a blockchain can be helpful in enabling individuals to exert control over their identity.</p><h2 id="Voting-Blockchain-Applications"><a href="#Voting-Blockchain-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Voting -Blockchain Applications"></a>Voting -Blockchain Applications</h2><p>Voting is an absolutely essential tool for any democratic government. That is the most crucial factor that makes a government nor the people and by the people In truth, if it wasn’t for voting than the principle of a ‘free country’ might not even exist. Having said that, it is absolutely fascinating and shocking that we have still not moved on from the traditional document ballot approach to voting.</p><p>Typically the paper ballot system has long been utilised by nations around the world around the world. The particular concept is simple, you put your vote on a part of paper and put it in a ballot box. At the ending of the election, the ballots are counted and the person who gets the most ballots is the winner. Nevertheless, as simple as it may sound, there are a lot of issues that can happen because of traditional paper balloting system.</p><h2 id="The-Problems-with-Traditional-Paper-Ballot-Method"><a href="#The-Problems-with-Traditional-Paper-Ballot-Method" class="headerlink" title="The Problems with Traditional Paper Ballot Method"></a>The Problems with Traditional Paper Ballot Method</h2><p>The machine cannot be computerized and is extremely boring. From actually physically going to the venues where the ballot boxes are kept to waiting in long lines. The whole process is extremely time-consuming.</p><ul><li>The amount of time taken to count the votes is too high.</li><li>The election can be hijacked via the insertion of bogus ballot papers.</li><li>More powerful parties are able to use intimidation tactics on the venues to rig the election in a certain way.</li><li>The amount of paper wastage can cause harm to environmental surroundings.</li><li>Right now there is no historical document possible to keep monitor of each and every vote made.</li><li>Typically the cost of expenditure on paper ballots is quite high.</li><li>It is impossible to read your vote.</li><li>When you have cast a political election you are unable to change it.</li></ul><p>So as you can see, there are a lot of disadvantages of a paper ballot system. To counter this a digital voting system was employed by countries like Estonia. As The Economist reports, Estonia has had electric voting since 2005. Inside fact, during the 2015 parliamentary elections, 30. five per cent of the votes were done digitally.</p><p>However, there were some possible issues in the system that were pointed out (data obtained from The Economist).</p><p>To begin with, the client side machine could develop a spyware and adware which reads each and every vote cast and changes the vote to the other candidate.</p><p>An attacker can directly infect the machines through malware put on the DVDs used to set up the servers and transfer the votes.</p><p>While problems were criticized and competitive by the Estonian Information Systems Authority, the reality remains that having a centralized server taking treatment of the votes can be susceptible to multiple attacks and hacks.</p><h2 id="Typically-the-Blockchain-Solution"><a href="#Typically-the-Blockchain-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Typically the Blockchain Solution"></a>Typically the Blockchain Solution</h2><p>Companies like ‘Follow My Vote’ are using the blockchain technology and Elliptical Curve Cryptography to bring voting to the modern world. Their goal is simple, make political election process as transparent as possible. What exactly happens to your votes after you cast it? Hardly anyone knows that. Therefore , how is integrating blockchain technology going to fix this?</p><p>This is exactly what Follow Our Vote is planning to do. Any potential divider can securely login using their webcam and government issued ID. After they are carried out the voting, anyone may use their voting IDENTIFICATION in order to their votes and be sure it has recently been cast correctly. In addition. These people even give their voters the ability to change their votes any quantity of times till the deadline.</p><p>They use Elliptical trainer Curve Cryptography (ECC) to produce these votes. ECC is a form of asymmetric cryptography. Asymmetric cryptography uses two secrets (a public key and a private key) to encrypt and decrypt data. ECC is basically what bitcoin and ethereum use for their cryptography. A single thing to note, the private key should not be revealed to anyone but the user and the public key creates a public address which is shared with everyone.</p><p>Just how do Follow My Election utilize this technology to create their votes?</p><p>During Divider Registration, the voter creates two ECC key-pairs. Typically the voter reveals their identity to a verifier who certifies the initial key couple. Once that is done, the voter registers their second key pair anonymously as belonging to the first pair. The first key-pair is named ‘identity key-pair’ while the second is called ‘voting key-pair’.</p><p>Typically the voter can then create a transaction which is basically their vote and sign them off with their voting private key. Once the vote is done, anyone can confirm whether the signature is valid or not and ensure that none of the votes have been tampered with. They might simply confirm using the voter’s general public key to check whether it is indeed the voter who did the voting or not.</p><h2 id="Terrain-Registry"><a href="#Terrain-Registry" class="headerlink" title="Terrain Registry"></a>Terrain Registry</h2><p>India has seemed into the blockchain technology as a possible solution to their land computer registry problems. Property fraud is one of the biggest issues in India.</p><p>Look at this for a second.</p><p>In 2013, New Delhi alone had 181 reported cases of property fraud while Mumbai came a close second at 173 cases. Thus, to counter this concern, the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have partnered program Swedish start-up ChromaWay to set their land registry on the blockchain.</p><p>The execution is proceeding to be extremely uncomplicated.</p><p>The device will have a blockchain back-end and a web app front-end. Typically the front-end will aid in the overall system entire. ChromaWay will be using their own database program called ‘Hostchain’. </p><p>As per International Business Periods: Hostchain is built from the ground up to work with most widely-used programs, and integrating it into the government’s systems is done seamlessly.</p><p>One of the numerous interesting innovations that they possibly could be doing is the introduction of cryptographically secure, digital finger prints.</p><ul><li>This is one way it can possibly work:</li><li>A new hash is taken of the geo-coordinates together with a polygonal description of the land.</li><li>This hash is tied to the owner’s ID and the effect is hashed again and added to the blockchain.</li><li>Since the hash is always a unique value, everyone will have a unique ID. As well as, because of the blockchain’s immutability, nobody can tamper with the records.</li></ul><p>J A Chowdary, Special Chief Secretary &amp; IT advisor to Andhra Pradesh CM N. Chandrababu Naidu had this to say about this innovation,</p><blockquote><br>“Blockchain is the technology for the future. It will not only change the way we perceive processes but it also has got the prospective to transform the overall economy. Naturally , we all are yet to fully discover this technology thus the Government of Andhra Pradesh has engaged with startups from across the globe such as ChromaWay to run proofs of concept within its own departments. ChromaWay’s expertise and previous execution in countries such as Sweden have added enormous value to our understanding of blockchain.”<br></blockquote><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>As you can see, there are many more blockchain applications than just cryptocurrency and can affect way more sectors than just the finance sector. We deliberately avoided showing the blockchain’s impact on the banking sector to keep the list as non-fintech as possible. We desire that guide will educate you and encourage you about the possibilities of the wonderful and disruptive technology.</p>]]></content>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/4.jpg" alt=""></p><p>With blockchain technology, the web increases a new layer of features.</p><p>Already, users can work directly with one one more Bitcoin transactions inside 2016 averaged over one hundred dollar, 000 US each day. Together with the added security through the blockchain new internet business are on track to be able to unbundle the traditional establishments of finance.</p><p>Goldman Sachs believes that blockchain technological innovation holds great potential specially to optimize clearing and settlements, and could represent worldwide savings of up to $6bn each year.</p><a id="more"></a><p>2017 is a critical year for blockchain technology. Many of the startup companies within the space will possibly start producing income via providing products the market demands/values or perhaps vaporize because of running away of cash. In additional words, 2017 should be the year where presently there is more implementation regarding products utilizing blockchain technology, and less speak about blockchain tech being the wonderful pixie dust that may you should be sprinkled atop almost everything. Naturally , from a consumers viewpoint, this can not end up being clear as blockchain technology should dominantly be hidden even as the features and functionality increase peoples’ business’ lives. I in person am familiar with a number of large-scale blockchain tech use cases which can be launching soon/2017. This setup stage, which 2017 need to represent, is a essential step up the larger re-homing of blockchain tech, because it will allow cynics to see the functionality, instead of just hear of its promise.</p><h1 id="The-Particular-Blockchain-a-New-Net-3-0"><a href="#The-Particular-Blockchain-a-New-Net-3-0" class="headerlink" title="The Particular Blockchain a New Net 3. 0"></a>The Particular Blockchain a New Net 3. 0</h1><p>The blockchain gives internet users typically the ability to create value and authenticates digital details. What will new business applications result?</p><h2 id="Smart-agreements"><a href="#Smart-agreements" class="headerlink" title="Smart agreements"></a>Smart agreements</h2><p>Distributed ledgers enable typically the coding of simple deals that may execute when particular the weather is met. Ethereum will be an free blockchain job that was built specifically to know this probability. Still, in its initial phases, Ethereum has the potential to leverage the effectiveness of blockchains on a truly world-changing scale.</p><p>In the technology’s current amount of development, smart contracts may be programmed to perform easy functions. For instance, a new derivative could possibly be paid out there when a financial device meets certain benchmark, with the application of blockchain technology plus Bitcoin enabling the payment to be automated.</p><h2 id="Typically-the-sharing-economy"><a href="#Typically-the-sharing-economy" class="headerlink" title="Typically the sharing economy"></a>Typically the sharing economy</h2><p>With firms like Uber and AirBnB flourishing, the sharing economy has already been a tested accomplishment. Currently, however, users who else want to hail a new ride-sharing service must count on an intermediary like Uber. By enabling peer-to-peer repayments, the blockchain clears the way to be able to direct interaction between parties a truly decentralized sharing economy results.</p><p>A beginning example, OpenBazaar uses the particular blockchain to create the peer-to-peer eBay. Download the iPhone app on your computing system, and you may transact with OpenBazzar vendors without having to pay transaction costs. The ‘quo rules’ cast of the protocol implies that personal reputation will probably be also more important to enterprise interactions than it at present is on eBay.</p><h2 id="Crowdfunding"><a href="#Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="Crowdfunding"></a>Crowdfunding</h2><p>Crowdfunding initiatives like Kickstarter and Gofundme are doing the advance work regarding the emerging peer-to-peer economy. The popularity of these kinds of sites suggests folks need to have an immediate point out in product development. Blockchains take this interest to be able to the next level, probably creating crowd-sourced venture money funds.</p><p>In 2016, 1 such experiment, the Ethereum-based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), raised a stunning $200 million USD in only over two months. Participants purchased ‘DAO tokens’ allowing them in order to vote on smart contract capital raising investments (voting strength was proportionate to typically the number of DAO they will were holding). A following hack of project funds proved that the task premiered without proper credited diligence, with disastrous consequences. Regardless, the DAO test suggests the blockchain offers the potential to Jason Derulo in ‘a new paradigm of economical cooperation’. </p><h2 id="Governance"><a href="#Governance" class="headerlink" title="Governance"></a>Governance</h2><p>By making the results fully transparent and publicly accessible, distributed repository technology could bring total transparency to elections or perhaps any other kind of vote taking. Ethereum-based smart deals help to automate the process.</p><p>The app, Boardroom, allows organizational decision-making in order to happen on the blockchain. In practice, this means company governance becomes totally transparent and verifiable any time managing digital assets, equity or information.</p><h2 id="Supply-cycle-auditing"><a href="#Supply-cycle-auditing" class="headerlink" title="Supply cycle auditing"></a>Supply cycle auditing</h2><p>Consumers increasingly need to know that the particular ethical claims companies make about their products are actual. Distributed ledgers provide a fairly easy way to certify of which the backstories of the things we buy are usually genuine. Transparency comes together with blockchain-based time-stamping of a new date and location on ethical diamonds, as an example that corresponds to a product number.</p><p>The UK-based Provenance offers supply cycle auditing for a range of consumer goods. Making use of the Ethereum blockchain, a Provenance pilot job ensures that fish bought from Sushi restaurants in The Japanese has been sustainably collected by its vendors inside Indonesia.</p><h2 id="File-storage"><a href="#File-storage" class="headerlink" title="File storage"></a>File storage</h2><p>Decentralizing file storage on the particular internet brings clear rewards. Distributing data through the entire system protects files from obtaining hacked or lost.</p><p>Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) makes it easy to contemplate how a distributed web may operate. Similar to the particular way a bit-torrent techniques data around the internet, IPFS gets rid regarding the need for central client-server relationships (i. electronic., the current web). A great internet consisting of completely decentralized websites has the potential to be able to speed up file exchange and streaming times. This improvement is not simply convenient. The new necessary improve to the web’s at present overloaded content-delivery systems.</p><h2 id="Prediction-markets"><a href="#Prediction-markets" class="headerlink" title="Prediction markets"></a>Prediction markets</h2><p>The crowdsourcing of predictions on event likelihood is proven to have a high degree of accuracy. Averaging opinions cancels out the unexamined biases that distort judgement. Prediction markets that payout according to event outcomes are already active. Blockchains are a ‘wisdom of the crowd’ technology that will no doubt find other apps in the years to come.</p><p>Still, in Beta, the prediction market application Augur makes share choices on the end result of actual events. Participants can earn money by buying in to the correct prediction. The more shares purchased in the correct outcome, the higher the payout will be. With a little commitment of funds (less when compared to a dollar), anyone can ask a question, create a market according to a predicted result, and gather half of all transaction fees the market generates.</p><h2 id="Protection-of-intellectual-property"><a href="#Protection-of-intellectual-property" class="headerlink" title="Protection of intellectual property"></a>Protection of intellectual property</h2><p>As is well known, digital information can be infinitely reproduced and distributed widely because of the internet. This has given web users globally a goldmine of free content. Yet , copyright holders have not been so lucky, shedding control of their intellectual property and suffering financially as a consequence. Smart deals can protect copyright and automate the sale of creative works online, getting rid of the risk of file copying and redistribution.</p><p>Mycelia uses the blockchain to create a peer-to-peer songs distribution system. Founded by the UK singer-songwriter Imogen Heap, Mycelia allows artists to offer songs directly to audiences, as well as license samples to suppliers and divvy up royalties to songwriters and artists most of these functions being automated by smart deals. The capacity of blockchains to issue payments in fractional cryptocurrency amounts (micro-payments) suggests this use circumstance for the blockchain has a strong chance of success.</p><h2 id="Internet-of-Items-IoT"><a href="#Internet-of-Items-IoT" class="headerlink" title="Internet of Items (IoT)"></a>Internet of Items (IoT)</h2><p>What is the IoT? The network-controlled management of certain types of electronic devices for instance, the monitoring of air temp in a storage center. Smart contracts make motorisation of remote systems management possible. A mixture of software, sensors, and the network facilitates an exchange of data between things and mechanisms. The effect increases system efficiency and boosts cost monitoring.</p><p>Typically the biggest players that manufactures, technical and telecommunications are typical competing for IoT dominance. Consider Samsung, IBM and AT&amp;T. A natural extension of existing infrastructure controlled by incumbents, IoT applications will run the gamut from predictive repair of mechanical components to data analytics, and mass-scale automated systems management.</p><h2 id="Neighbourhood-Microgrids"><a href="#Neighbourhood-Microgrids" class="headerlink" title="Neighbourhood Microgrids"></a>Neighbourhood Microgrids</h2><p>Blockchain technology allows the buying and selling of the alternative energy generated by neighbourhood microgrids. Any time solar panels make extra energy, Ethereum-based smart agreements automatically redistribute it. Comparable types of smart deal automation will have several other applications because the IoT becomes a reality.</p><p>Positioned in Brooklyn, Consensys is 1 of the foremost firms globally that is having a range of applications regarding Ethereum. One project these people are partnering on will be Transactive Grid, working together with the distributed energy attire, LO3. A prototype task currently up and working uses Ethereum smart deals to automate the checking and redistribution of microgrid energy. This so-called ‘intelligent grid’ is an early example of IoT efficiency.</p><h2 id="Identity-management"><a href="#Identity-management" class="headerlink" title="Identity management"></a>Identity management</h2><p>There exists a particular need for better identity management on the web. The ability to verify your identity is the particular lynchpin of financial dealings that happen online. Nevertheless, treatments for that security hazards that come with web commerce are imperfect best case scenario. Distributed ledgers offer increased methods for proving who else you are, along with the likelihood to digitize personal paperwork. Having a secure personality will also be essential for online interactions for instance, in the sharing economy. A great reputation, after all, is usually the main condition for conducting transactions online.</p><p>Developing electronic digital identity standards is demonstrating to be a highly complex process. Technical difficulties aside, a universal on-line identity solution requires co-operation between private entities plus government. Moreover, the need to navigate legal systems in several countries and the condition becomes exponentially difficult. E-Commerce on the internet currently relies on the SSL certificate (the little eco-friendly lock) for secure purchases on the web. Netki is a startup that plans to generate an SSL regular for your blockchain. Having just lately has announced a $3. 5 , 000, 000 seed round, Netki needs a product or service launch in early 2017.</p><h2 id="AML-and-KYC"><a href="#AML-and-KYC" class="headerlink" title="AML and KYC"></a>AML and KYC</h2><p>Anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) practices have a very strong potential for being adapted to the blockchain. Currently, financial institutions must perform a time intensive multi-step process for every single new customer. KYC expenses could be reduced through cross-institution client verification, and at the same time enhance monitoring and analysis performance.</p><p>Startup Polycoin has an AML/KYC solution that requires analysing transactions. Those dealings determined as being suspect are forwarded on to compliance officers. Another new venture Tradle is developing a good application called Trust within Motion (TiM). Characterized since an ‘instagram for KYC’ TiM allows customers to take a snapshot of crucial documents (passport, utility bill, etc. ). Once validated by the bank, this specific data is cryptographically stashed within the blockchain.</p><h2 id="Data-administration"><a href="#Data-administration" class="headerlink" title="Data administration"></a>Data administration</h2><p>Today, in exchange for their personal data folks can use social media platforms like Facebook regarding free. In future, users may have the ability in order to manage promote the info their online activity creates. Because it can become easily distributed in small fractional amounts, Bitcoin or something like that probably will be the particular currency that gets applied for this sort of transaction.</p><p>The MIT project Enigma understands that user privacy is the particular key precondition for creating of a personal info marketplace. Enigma uses cryptographic techniques to allow individual data sets to end up being split between nodes, in addition to at the same time run bulk computations more than the data group because a whole. Fragmenting typically the data also makes Stew scalable (unlike those blockchain solutions where data becomes replicated in each node). The Beta launch is assured within the next half a year.</p><h2 id="Land-title-registration"><a href="#Land-title-registration" class="headerlink" title="Land title registration"></a>Land title registration</h2><p>Since Publicly-accessible ledgers, blockchains can make all types of record-keeping more successful. Property titles are the case in point. They have a tendency to be susceptible to be able to fraud, as well as costly in addition to labour intensive to provide.</p><p>A number of nations around the world take on blockchain-based land computer registry projects. Honduras was the first government to mention such an initiative in 2015, although the existing status of that job is unclear. This year, the Republic of Atlanta cemented a manage typically the Bitfury Group to create a blockchain system regarding property titles.

By storing blocks details that are identical across its network, the blockchain cannot:</p><ul><li>Be manipulated by any single entity.</li><li>Does not have single point of failure.</li></ul><p>Bitcoin was invented in 2008. Since that time, the Bitcoin blockchain has operated without important interruption. (To date, any of problems associated with Bitcoin have been due to hacking or mismanagement. Inside other words, these problems are derived from bad intention and human error, not imperfections in the underlying principles.)</p><a id="more"></a><p>The web itself has proven to be durable for almost 30 years. It’s a track record that bodes well for blockchain technology as it proceeds to be developed.</p><p>As revolutionary as it noises, Blockchain truly is a mechanism to bring everyone to the best degree of accountability. No more skipped transactions, human or machine errors, or even an exchange that was not done with the consent of the parties involved. Previously mentioned everything else, the most critical area where Blockchain helps is to ensure the validity of a transaction by recording it not is without a doubt a main register but a attached distributed system of registers, all of which are attached via a secure validation mechanism.</p><h1 id="Transparent-and-Incorruptible"><a href="#Transparent-and-Incorruptible" class="headerlink" title="Transparent and Incorruptible"></a>Transparent and Incorruptible</h1><p>Typically the blockchain network lives in a state of consensus, the one which automatically checks in with itself every ten minutes. A kind of self-auditing ecosystem of a digital value, the network reconciles every transaction that happens in ten-minute intervals. Every group of these dealings is referred to as a ‘Block’. Two important properties result from this:</p><ul><li>Openness data is embedded within the network as a whole, by definition it is public.</li><li>It should not be corrupted altering any unit of information on the blockchain would mean by using a huge amount of computer power to override the whole network.</li></ul><p>In theory, this could be possible. Inside practice, it’s unlikely to take place. Taking control of the system to capture Bitcoins, for instance, would likewise have the effect of wrecking their value.</p><p>Blockchain resolves the condition of manipulation. Any time I discuss it in the West, people say they trust Google, Facebook, or their banks. But the rest of the world doesn’t trust organizations and corporations much. I mean Africa, India, the Eastern Europe, or Russian federation. It’s not about the places where people are really rich. Blockchain’s opportunities are the highest in the countries that haven’t reached that level yet.</p><h1 id="A-Network-of-Nodes"><a href="#A-Network-of-Nodes" class="headerlink" title="A Network of Nodes"></a>A Network of Nodes</h1><p>A network of so-called computing ‘nodes’ make up the blockchain.</p><h2 id="Client"><a href="#Client" class="headerlink" title="Client"></a>Client</h2><p>(computer linked to the blockchain network by using a client that performs the task of validating and communicating transactions) gets a duplicate of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically after joining the blockchain community.</p><p>Together they create a powerful second-level network, a wholly different vision for the way the internet can function.</p><p>Every client is an ‘Administrator’ of the blockchain, and brings together the network voluntarily (in this sense, the community is decentralized). However, each one has an incentive for participating in the community: the chance of earning Bitcoins.</p><p>Nodes are said to be Mining-Bitcoin, but the term is something of a misnomer. In truth, each one is contending to win Bitcoins by solving computational puzzles. Bitcoin was your raison d’etre of the blockchain as it was formerly conceived. It is now recognized to be only the first of many potential applications of the technology.</p><p>There are an estimated 700 Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies (exchangeable value tokens) already available. As well, a range of other prospective adaptations of the initial blockchain concept are currently lively, or in development.</p><p>Bitcoin has the same figure a fax machine had.

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/5.jpg" alt=""></p><p>It will be an understatement to say that the Blockchain Technology any of the most innovations of this century. Whenever we think of it, we automatically associate with the cryptocurrencies, and primarily bitcoin. Yet , that notion is changing at a rapid rate. More and more people are seeing that the decentralization and openness that will come by using the blockchain technology has the potential to shake multiple industries to its very core. This particular article explores different blockchain applications.</p><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Blockchain-Applications-for-the-Real-World"><a href="#Blockchain-Applications-for-the-Real-World" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain Applications for the Real World"></a>Blockchain Applications for the Real World</h1><p>Just before we look into industries which have blockchain applications, let’s reacquaint ourselves with the blockchain technology now, shall we?</p><h2 id="What-is-the-Blockchain-Technology"><a href="#What-is-the-Blockchain-Technology" class="headerlink" title="What is the Blockchain Technology?"></a>What is the Blockchain Technology?</h2><p>The blockchain is a chain of blocks where each block includes data of value without the main supervision. It is cryptographically secure and immutable. A blockchain uses two important data structures: Pointers and Linked Lists.</p><h3 id="Ideas"><a href="#Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Ideas"></a>Ideas</h3><p>Pointers are variables in programming which stores the address of another varying. Usually normal variables in any programming language stores data.</p><p>Eg. int a = 10, means there is a variable which stores integer values. In cases like this, it is storing an integer value which is 10. This is a normal variable.</p><p>Pointers, however, as opposed to storing values will store addresses of other variables. This is why they are called pointers, because they are virtually pointing towards the location of other variables.</p><h3 id="Associated-Lists"><a href="#Associated-Lists" class="headerlink" title="Associated Lists"></a>Associated Lists</h3><p>A linked listing is one of the main items in data structures.</p><p>It is just a sequence of blocks, each containing data which is linked to the next block via a tip. The pointer variable, in this case, contains the address of the next node in it thus the connection is made. The last node, as you can see, has a null pointer which means that the tip has no value.</p><p>A single important things to note here, the pointer inside each block contains the address of the next block. Of which is how the aiming is achieved. Now you might be asking what does that mean for the first block in the list? Where does the pointer of the initial block stay?</p><p>The first block is called the ‘genesis block’ and their pointer lies in the system itself.</p><p>As you could have guessed by now, this is what the structure of the blockchain is based on. A blockchain is simply a associated list.</p><p>The blockchain is a linked list which contains data and a hash pointer which factors to its previous obstruct, hence creating the cycle. What is a hash pointer? A hash tip is similar to a pointer, but rather than just containing the address of the previous block it also contains the hash of your data inside the previous block. That one small tweak is what makes blockchains so amazingly reliable and trailblazing.</p><p>Remember this point because we will be back in it in a bit.</p><hr><p>So, the two most interesting facets of the blockchain technology are:</p><ul><li>Decentralization.</li><li>Immutability.</li></ul><h3 id="Decentralization"><a href="#Decentralization" class="headerlink" title="Decentralization"></a>Decentralization</h3><p>A normal network structure is the ‘client-server’ structure.</p><p><strong>How does that work?</strong></p><p>There is a centralized server. And everyone who wants to link with the server can send a query to get the required information. This specific is just about how the internet works. When you need to Google something, you send a query to the Google server, which returns with the required results. So, this is a client-server system. Now, what is the condition with this model?</p><p>Since everything is dependent on the server, it is critical for the server to be functioning always for the system to work. It is just a bottleneck. Now suppose, for whatever reason the main server stops working, everyone in the network will be affected. Plus, there are also security concerns. Considering that the network is centralized, the server itself handles a lot of sensitive information in connection with clients. This means that anyone can hack the server and get those parts of information. Plus, there is also the concern of censorship. What if the server decides that a particular item (movie, song, book etc. ) is not agreeable and decides not to pass on it in their community?</p><p>Therefore , to counter all these issues, a different kind of network structure came about. It is a network which partitioning its entire workload among participants, who will be all similarly privileged, called ‘peers’. Presently there is no longer one key server, now there are a lot distributed and decentralized peers. This is a peer-to-peer network.</p><p><strong>Why do people use peer-to-peer community?</strong></p><p>One of the key uses of peer-to-peer network is file sharing, also called ‘torrenting’. If you are to use a client-server model for downloading, then it is usually extremely slow and completely dependent on the health of the storage space. Plus, like we said, it is prone to censorship.</p><p>Yet , in a peer-to-peer system, there is no core authority, and hence if even one of the peers in the network goes out of the race, you still have more peers to download from. Plus, it is not subject to the idealistic standards of a core system, hence it is not prone to censorship.</p><h3 id="Immutability"><a href="#Immutability" class="headerlink" title="Immutability"></a>Immutability</h3><p><strong>What is immutability?</strong></p><p>Immutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that once something has already been entered into the blockchain, it cannot be interfered with. The reason why the blockchain gets this property is that of cryptographic hash function.</p><p>Within simple terms, hashing means taking an input string of any length and giving out an end result of a fixed size. Inside the context of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the transactions are taken as an input and run through a hashing algorithm (bitcoin uses SHA-256) which provides an output of a repaired length.</p><p>the case of SHA-256, no matter how big or small your input is, the result will always have a set 256-bits length. This becomes critical when you are dealing with a large amount of data and purchases. So basically, rather than remembering the input data which could be huge, you can remember the hash and keep track.</p><p>A new cryptographic hash function is a special class of hash functions which has various properties so that it is perfect for cryptography. There are certain properties that a cryptographic hash function needs to have to become considered secure. You can read about those in detail in our guide on hashing.</p><p>There is simply one property that we want you to give attention to today. It truly is called the ‘Avalanche Result’.</p><p><strong>What does that mean?</strong></p><p>Even if you make a tiny change in your input, the changes that will be mirrored in the hash will be huge.</p><p>Even though you just changed the case of the first alphabet of the input, check out how much that has afflicted the end result hash. Now, let’s go back to our previous point when we were taking a look at blockchain architecture. Just what we said was:</p><blockquote><br>Typically the blockchain is a linked list which contains data and a hash tip which take into account its prior block, hence creating the chain. What is a hash pointer? A hash pointer is similar to a pointer, but instead of just containing the tackle of the previous block it also contains the hash of the data inside the prior block.<br></blockquote><p>This specific one small tweak is what makes blockchains so amazingly reliable and trailblazing.</p><p>Imagine this for a second, a hacker episodes block 3 and will try to change the data. Because of the properties of hash functions, a slight change in data will change the hash drastically. This means that any slight changes made in block 3, will alter the hash which is stored in block 2, since in turn will change the data and the hash of obstruct 2 which will lead to within block 1 and so on and so forth. This specific will completely change the chain, which is impossible. This really is how blockchains attain immutability.</p><p>Now that we really know what the blockchain technology is, let’s look at its blockchain applications in several industries.</p>]]></content>

Some important implications stem from this. By creating a new way to verify dealings aspects of traditional trade could become unnecessary. Stock market trades become almost simultaneous on the blockchain, for instance or it could make types of record keeping, like a land registry, completely public. And decentralization is already a reality.</p><a id="more"></a><p>A global network of computers uses blockchain technology to collectively manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. That may be, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not anybody core authority. Decentralization means the network works on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. The kinds of mass collaboration this makes possible are just beginning to be investigated.</p><p>That will use the blockchain?</p><p>As web infrastructure, you don’t need to know about the blockchain for it to be within your life.</p><p>Currently, finance supplies the best use cases for the technology. International remittances, for instance. The World Financial institution estimates that over $430 billion US in money transfers were sent in 2015. And at the moment there is a high demand for blockchain developers.</p><p>The blockchain potentially slashes out the middleman for these kind of transactions. Personal computer became accessible to the general public with the invention of the Graphical Customer Interface (GUI), which took the form of a ‘Desktop’ Similarly, the most frequent GUI devised for the blockchain are the so-called ‘Wallet’ applications, which people use to buy things with Bitcoin, and store it along with other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Transactions online are carefully connected to the procedures of identity verification. This is easy to imagine that wallet apps will convert in the coming years to include other types of identity management.</p><h2 id="The-Blockchain-amp-Enhanced-security"><a href="#The-Blockchain-amp-Enhanced-security" class="headerlink" title="The Blockchain &amp; Enhanced security"></a>The Blockchain &amp; Enhanced security</h2><p>By simply storing data across their network, the blockchain gets rid of the risks that come with data being held on the inside.</p><p>Its network lacks central points of vulnerability that computer hackers can take advantage of. Today’s internet has security problems that are acquainted to everyone. We all rely on the ‘username/password’ system to guard our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods use security technology.</p><p>The foundation for this are the so-called public and ‘private keys’. A new ‘public key’ (a long, randomly-generated string of numbers) is a users-tackle on the blockchain. Bitcoins sent across the system gets recorded as that belong to that address. The ‘private key’ is much like a password that gives their owner access to their Bitcoin or other digital assets. Store your data on the blockchain and it is incorruptible. This is correct, although protecting your digital assets will also require safeguarding of your private key by printing it, creating what’s referred to as a paper budget.</p>]]></content>

Then suppose this particular network is designed to be able to regularly update this chart in addition to a basic understanding of the blockchain.</p><p>Details held on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. This will be a way of utilizing the network that has apparent benefits. The blockchain repository isn’t saved in any kind of single location, meaning typically the records it keeps usually are truly public and quickly verifiable. No centralized variation of this information is available for a hacker in order to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, their data is accessible to be able to anyone on the internet.</p><p>To go in further with the Google chart analogy, I would just like you to check out this piece from a blockchain expert.</p><h2 id="Blockchain-as-Google-Documents"><a href="#Blockchain-as-Google-Documents" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain as Google Documents"></a>Blockchain as Google Documents</h2><p>The traditional way of sharing documents with effort is always to send a Microsoft company Word document to an additional recipient, and ask them in order to make revisions into it. The particular problem with that situation is that you should wait right up until acquiring a positive return copy just before you can see or perhaps make other changes when you are locked out of editing it until typically the other person is completed along with it. That’s how sources work today. Two owners can’t be messing together with the same record in once. That’s how financial institutions maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly secure access (or decrease the balance) while they help to make a transfer, then upgrade the other side, and then re-open access (or update again). With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to typically the same document concurrently, in addition to the single version of this document is always obvious to both of these people. It is like a new shared ledger, but that is a shared record. The distributed part will come into play when discussing involves a number associated with people. Imagine the quantity of legal documents that will should be used that way. Instead of passing these people to each other, losing track of versions, and not being in sync with the particular other version, why can not <em>all</em> business documents become shared as opposed to transferred again and forth. Numerous sorts of legal contracts will be suitable for that form of work. You don’t have to have a blockchain to share documents, but the shared documents example is a powerful a single.</p>]]></content>

Blockchain developers are a real unicorn right now because a whole lot of companies and startup companies are trying to find this expertise, but just a few people in the world work in this field.</p><p>That said, We want to demonstrate the best blockchain developer tools you should consider if you have already started out to work in this environment or if you are a newbie. People in the community dispute that the blockchain will disrupt any industry, just like what happened with the Internet back in the 90s. However how can it be used to build the so-called DAPPs (decentralized applications).</p><a id="more"></a><p>The blockchain isn’t just a network for transactions and store of value, but it can also execute programs. Several blockchains are able to contain programs, called smart contracts, such as the situation of the Ethereum string. A smart contract can be explained as a promise that signing parties agree on specific phrases written on the contract itself. For example, if you need to rent an apartment, the loaner might ask you to pay down-payment before you move.</p><p>Instead of relying on notaries and banks, you can both write and signal a smart contract establishing out the words of the let and the related deposit. In the event that some of the words aren’t respected, the money would be came back to the legitimate operator without the need for any intervention by legal professionals.</p><p>In fact, smart deals allow you to avoid any intervention by banks, lawyers, and any the courtroom. Just write a program that defines how much money should be transmitted in answer in order to meet specific conditions.</p><h1 id="The-Best-Blockchain-Developer-Resources-Checklist"><a href="#The-Best-Blockchain-Developer-Resources-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="The Best Blockchain Developer Resources Checklist"></a>The Best Blockchain Developer Resources Checklist</h1><h2 id="Decentralized-and-open-public-blockchains"><a href="#Decentralized-and-open-public-blockchains" class="headerlink" title="Decentralized and open public blockchains"></a>Decentralized and open public blockchains</h2><p>The blockchains can potentially eliminate all the intermediaries needed in order to build trust.</p><p>To accomplish this, of course, you seldom have to build your own blockchain, but you will be able to use already existing systems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Hyperledger. Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized, open source and public restaurants, while Hyperledger is a private one- but also free created by the Linux Foundation. Associated with course, they are different enough, and we have to say that Bitcoin is not a good choice to build DAPPS on because it was suitable for peer-to-peer transactions and not for this task.</p><p>Nevertheless, let’s check out the most successful tools for a blockchain developers, both for bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><h2 id="Blockchain-Testnet"><a href="#Blockchain-Testnet" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain Testnet"></a>Blockchain Testnet</h2><p>If you are blockchain developer, whether you want to create a new DAPP using Ethereum or another chain, you should use the related testnet or a system that works instead for the real blockchain that you want to use for the real DAPP.</p><h2 id="BaaS-blockchain-as-a-service-by-Microsoft"><a href="#BaaS-blockchain-as-a-service-by-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="BaaS: blockchain as a service by Microsoft"></a>BaaS: blockchain as a service by Microsoft</h2><p>Microsoft Glowing blue created the so-called BaaS, or Blockchain as a service, a great tool for developers to build DAPPs in a safe and less expensive environment that supports several chains, including MultiChain, Eris, Storj, and Augur. BaaS was created with the principle goal of enabling the backend the features needed by blockchain solutions, so you can launch the blockchain with merely a few clicks, rather than establishing up your own on Azure.</p><h3 id="Mist"><a href="#Mist" class="headerlink" title="Mist"></a>Mist</h3><p>For Ethereum developer, you can use Misting not only to store Ether or send dealings but in addition to deploy smart contracts. You can use the native Mist software in order to develop your DAPPs on the Ethereum blockchain or on its testnet. You just have to get Air and start working on the browser. Of course, to execute your own smart contract you will require to spend some Ether, because the fuel to run it on the Ethereum community. Ether, in fact, is like the electricity that keeps Ethereum alive.</p><h3 id="Coinbase’s-API"><a href="#Coinbase’s-API" class="headerlink" title="Coinbase’s API"></a>Coinbase’s API</h3><p>Coinbase’s APIs allow blockchain developers to easily build new bitcoin software and integrate bitcoin into already existing applications. This system helps many features from gathering read-only data to building something really new. Also, Coinbase’s APIs provides a system to produce bitcoin wallets and addresses, buy, sell, send and obtain bitcoins worldwide, and they provide several client libraries and mobile SDKs that are quite useful for a developer.</p><h3 id="Tierion"><a href="#Tierion" class="headerlink" title="Tierion"></a>Tierion</h3><p>It permits to produce a verifiable database of any data or process on the bitcoin blockchain by providing developer tools &amp; API to add data to the distributed ledger. Tierior in addition has developed an open standard called ChainPoint for recording data and making receipts that have all the info needed to verify the data without relying on any intermediaries.</p><h3 id="Embark"><a href="#Embark" class="headerlink" title="Embark"></a>Embark</h3><p>It is a developer framework for Ethereum DAPPs, so this means that it lets you easily develop and deploy DAPPs, or a server-less html5 application that uses decentralized technologies. Embark helps you to create new smart contracts and make them available in the JS code. Also, it wrist watches for changes, and if you update the contract, Embark will automatically modify the contracts and their related DAPP.</p><h3 id="Ether-Scripter"><a href="#Ether-Scripter" class="headerlink" title="Ether Scripter"></a>Ether Scripter</h3><p>This is a tool that helps you writing the script (or code) of your smart contract. That is an user-friendly program created back in 2014. At the moment, it can only be applied with the Serpent programming terminology.</p><h3 id="Solc"><a href="#Solc" class="headerlink" title="Solc"></a>Solc</h3><p>Solc is the Solidity Compiler (Solidity is the programming language to write code on the Ethereum chain). A good number of Ethereum systems natively includes a solc implementation, but it is also packaged as a standalone module for an offline compiling. Therefore , you can decide to use web3. eth. compile. solid design to compile your Solid design files using your client, or you can start employing a solc. compile that doesn’t rely on any outside node.</p>]]></content>
