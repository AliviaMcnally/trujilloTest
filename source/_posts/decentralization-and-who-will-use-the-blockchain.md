# The Thought of Decentralization

By design, the blockchain is a decentralized technology.

Anything that happens into it is a functionality of the network as a whole. Some important implications stem from this. By creating a new way to verify dealings aspects of traditional trade could become unnecessary. Stock market trades become almost simultaneous on the blockchain, for instance or it could make types of record keeping, like a land registry, completely public. And decentralization is already a reality.

A global network of computers uses blockchain technology to collectively manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. That may be, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not anybody core authority. Decentralization means the network works on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. The kinds of mass collaboration this makes possible are just beginning to be investigated.

That will use the blockchain?

As web infrastructure, you don't need to know about the blockchain for it to be within your life.

Currently, finance supplies the best use cases for the technology. International remittances, for instance. The World Financial institution estimates that over $430 billion US in money transfers were sent in 2015. And at the moment there is a high demand for blockchain developers.

The blockchain potentially slashes out the middleman for these kind of transactions. Personal computer became accessible to the general public with the invention of the Graphical Customer Interface (GUI), which took the form of a 'Desktop' Similarly, the most frequent GUI devised for the blockchain are the so-called 'Wallet' applications, which people use to buy things with Bitcoin, and store it along with other cryptocurrencies.

Transactions online are carefully connected to the procedures of identity verification. This is easy to imagine that wallet apps will convert in the coming years to include other types of identity management.

## The Blockchain & Enhanced security

By simply storing data across their network, the blockchain gets rid of the risks that come with data being held on the inside.

Its network lacks central points of vulnerability that computer hackers can take advantage of. Today's internet has security problems that are acquainted to everyone. We all rely on the 'username/password' system to guard our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods use security technology.

The foundation for this are the so-called public and 'private keys'. A new 'public key' (a long, randomly-generated string of numbers) is a users-tackle on the blockchain. Bitcoins sent across the system gets recorded as that belong to that address. The 'private key' is much like a password that gives their owner access to their Bitcoin or other digital assets. Store your data on the blockchain and it is incorruptible. This is correct, although protecting your digital assets will also require safeguarding of your private key by printing it, creating what's referred to as a paper budget.
