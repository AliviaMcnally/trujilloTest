##	The Differences between Scanning Apps and Book Scanners

In the nowadays Digital Age, people’s desire for information acquisition has substantially increased. The reading, which remains the major mean of learning, has derived a new reading approach--digital reading. It soon becomes a new trend due to its convenience and efficiency. Consequently, book scanners have come into being and is fast developing. But before we have some insight into book scanner, let’s discuss some replacement questions first, which is can scanning apps or digital camera replace book scanner?

The answer is of course __NO__.

- Curved Surface
Since the book’s surface is not flat, it is necessary to adjust the focal length to stay in focus. Although the book can be posed as V shape, a digicam can only take pictures of a flat document with clear and legible text. 
- OCR Function
By far, OCR Function (Optical Character Recognition Technology) is not supported in digital camera and most of the scanning apps to convert the scanned documents into editable Word, PDF, TIFF, and Excel. Even now some apps can process the image and recognize the text, it has the risks that words are wrongly written or character missing.
- Scan Quality 
There is no doubt that the resolution and sensor of mobile phones are not as professional as those of digicam and book scanner. Book scanner often adopts industrial-grade sensor and picture processor that will greatly improve scanning quality. Besides, with no algorithm to optimize the content, it will be an annoying process to deal with the disturbing factors like the uneven height of the book, the edge, the lighting, and paging.
- Efficiency
The efficiency of a book scanner is much better than apps and digicam. With fast processing CMOS chip, the scan speed of a flat single page can be as fast as 1.5s-3s/page and the speed of scanning books is 1.5s-3s/dual pages, far surpassing the speed of apps and digicam.

Other than these four reasons, there remains a lot of differences in specs and setup. Theoretically, if given the professional equipment, one may replace document scanner at the expense of time and constant setup. Just as smartphones cannot replace digital SLR camera, scanning apps can not replace professional book scanner.

Nevertheless, consumers want their ideal products to possess alluring appearance, extraordinary performance, and absolute availability and effectiveness. To this extent, there is a scanner that matches these demands, by and large, that is, namely the CZUR Aura scanner which is capable to accelerate and facilitate your scanning needs.

In ultra-fast Aura [smart scanner](https://www.czur.com/), which is facilitated with 32 bits MIPS CPU and 14MP HD camera, saving your precious time without any doubt. Also, the auto-flatten & finger cots removal functions have obtained the patent and give you the good reading experience. Due to its unique foot operating pedal, users are able to trigger scanning with hands covering on the book. In addition, since Aura employs OCR method, it currently supports 187 languages, expediting files output to Word, JPG and PDF, and as for the converting time, it’s quite similar to scanning, namely, 2 seconds for one page. With barely 1.5 kilograms weight and foldable design, it’s overwhelmingly convenient to be portable so that you can take Aura to wherever you want, just like your laptop.

Aura is not solely a scanner, it can hold a concurrent post as a multifunctional lamp. Fitted out with 16 true white and 16 warm white LED lights along with its revolutionary array of lights and light settings, Aura can be switched to four light modes, respectively natural light, reading light, computer mode and smart lighting mode at night, benefiting to user’s eyes on many occasions. Furthermore, different lighting modes can be altered by the app, or easily controlled by sound, sufficiently demonstrating the significance of artificial intelligence.

Undoubtedly, CZUR Aura is hewing out a new trend of modern scanners, namely to coordinate with artificial intelligence in the Information Age. It is now available Indiegogo and has raised more than $600,000 USD at present. Surely it is solely a small step for CZUR in scanners area, but it will be a marvelous leap for other technologies, ranging from ordinary to exclusive ones.
