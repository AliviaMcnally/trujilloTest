When i recently write on this article, you should guess on bitcoin if you wish to find a high paying job because being a blockchain developer might become your game changer. Blockchain developers are a real unicorn right now because a whole lot of companies and startup companies are trying to find this expertise, but just a few people in the world work in this field.

That said, We want to demonstrate the best blockchain developer tools you should consider if you have already started out to work in this environment or if you are a newbie. People in the community dispute that the blockchain will disrupt any industry, just like what happened with the Internet back in the 90s. However how can it be used to build the so-called DAPPs (decentralized applications).

The blockchain isn't just a network for transactions and store of value, but it can also execute programs. Several blockchains are able to contain programs, called smart contracts, such as the situation of the Ethereum string. A smart contract can be explained as a promise that signing parties agree on specific phrases written on the contract itself. For example, if you need to rent an apartment, the loaner might ask you to pay down-payment before you move.

Instead of relying on notaries and banks, you can both write and signal a smart contract establishing out the words of the let and the related deposit. In the event that some of the words aren't respected, the money would be came back to the legitimate operator without the need for any intervention by legal professionals.

In fact, smart deals allow you to avoid any intervention by banks, lawyers, and any the courtroom. Just write a program that defines how much money should be transmitted in answer in order to meet specific conditions.

# The Best Blockchain Developer Resources Checklist

## Decentralized and open public blockchains

The blockchains can potentially eliminate all the intermediaries needed in order to build trust.

To accomplish this, of course, you seldom have to build your own blockchain, but you will be able to use already existing systems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Hyperledger. Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized, open source and public restaurants, while Hyperledger is a private one- but also free created by the Linux Foundation. Associated with course, they are different enough, and we have to say that Bitcoin is not a good choice to build DAPPS on because it was suitable for peer-to-peer transactions and not for this task.

Nevertheless, let's check out the most successful tools for a blockchain developers, both for bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Blockchain Testnet

If you are blockchain developer, whether you want to create a new DAPP using Ethereum or another chain, you should use the related testnet or a system that works instead for the real blockchain that you want to use for the real DAPP.

## BaaS: blockchain as a service by Microsoft

Microsoft Glowing blue created the so-called BaaS, or Blockchain as a service, a great tool for developers to build DAPPs in a safe and less expensive environment that supports several chains, including MultiChain, Eris, Storj, and Augur. BaaS was created with the principle goal of enabling the backend the features needed by blockchain solutions, so you can launch the blockchain with merely a few clicks, rather than establishing up your own on Azure.

### Mist

For Ethereum developer, you can use Misting not only to store Ether or send dealings but in addition to deploy smart contracts. You can use the native Mist software in order to develop your DAPPs on the Ethereum blockchain or on its testnet. You just have to get Air and start working on the browser. Of course, to execute your own smart contract you will require to spend some Ether, because the fuel to run it on the Ethereum community. Ether, in fact, is like the electricity that keeps Ethereum alive.

### Coinbase's API

Coinbase's APIs allow blockchain developers to easily build new bitcoin software and integrate bitcoin into already existing applications. This system helps many features from gathering read-only data to building something really new. Also, Coinbase's APIs provides a system to produce bitcoin wallets and addresses, buy, sell, send and obtain bitcoins worldwide, and they provide several client libraries and mobile SDKs that are quite useful for a developer.

### Tierion

It permits to produce a verifiable database of any data or process on the bitcoin blockchain by providing developer tools & API to add data to the distributed ledger. Tierior in addition has developed an open standard called ChainPoint for recording data and making receipts that have all the info needed to verify the data without relying on any intermediaries.

### Embark

It is a developer framework for Ethereum DAPPs, so this means that it lets you easily develop and deploy DAPPs, or a server-less html5 application that uses decentralized technologies. Embark helps you to create new smart contracts and make them available in the JS code. Also, it wrist watches for changes, and if you update the contract, Embark will automatically modify the contracts and their related DAPP.

### Ether Scripter

This is a tool that helps you writing the script (or code) of your smart contract. That is an user-friendly program created back in 2014. At the moment, it can only be applied with the Serpent programming terminology.

### Solc

Solc is the Solidity Compiler (Solidity is the programming language to write code on the Ethereum chain). A good number of Ethereum systems natively includes a solc implementation, but it is also packaged as a standalone module for an offline compiling. Therefore , you can decide to use web3. eth. compile. solid design to compile your Solid design files using your client, or you can start employing a solc. compile that doesn't rely on any outside node.
