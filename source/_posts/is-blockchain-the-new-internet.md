# What exactly is Blockchain Technology?

'The blockchain is an incorruptible electronic ledger of economical purchases that may be programmed to record not simply financial transactions but nearly everything of benefit.'
Don plus Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)

## A distributed data source

Picture a spreadsheet of which is duplicated 1000s of periods across a network regarding computers. Then suppose this particular network is designed to be able to regularly update this chart in addition to a basic understanding of the blockchain.

Details held on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. This will be a way of utilizing the network that has apparent benefits. The blockchain repository isn't saved in any kind of single location, meaning typically the records it keeps usually are truly public and quickly verifiable. No centralized variation of this information is available for a hacker in order to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, their data is accessible to be able to anyone on the internet.

To go in further with the Google chart analogy, I would just like you to check out this piece from a blockchain expert.

## Blockchain as Google Documents

The traditional way of sharing documents with effort is always to send a Microsoft company Word document to an additional recipient, and ask them in order to make revisions into it. The particular problem with that situation is that you should wait right up until acquiring a positive return copy just before you can see or perhaps make other changes when you are locked out of editing it until typically the other person is completed along with it. That's how sources work today. Two owners can't be messing together with the same record in once. That's how financial institutions maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly secure access (or decrease the balance) while they help to make a transfer, then upgrade the other side, and then re-open access (or update again). With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to typically the same document concurrently, in addition to the single version of this document is always obvious to both of these people. It is like a new shared ledger, but that is a shared record. The distributed part will come into play when discussing involves a number associated with people. Imagine the quantity of legal documents that will should be used that way. Instead of passing these people to each other, losing track of versions, and not being in sync with the particular other version, why can not *all* business documents become shared as opposed to transferred again and forth. Numerous sorts of legal contracts will be suitable for that form of work. You don't have to have a blockchain to share documents, but the shared documents example is a powerful a single.
